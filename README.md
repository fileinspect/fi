# fi

> Modern modal text editing.

The fi text editor is designed around three primary principles.

    Comfort > Speed

    Often, optimizing for comfort also necessitates improving speed of editing operations. Repeated operations that take too many keystrokes is less comfortable than if the same operation is done in less. However, in cases where speed of editing and user comfort is in conflict, user comfort should be prioritized.

    Batteries-included

    fi should come with sane defaults and commonly used text-editing functionality. This means no included IDE-magic, but default access to modern text editing conveniences such as file trees, tabs, etc...

    Portable

    fi is designed to run on most major platforms and operating systems, including but not limited to:
        Linux distributions
        MacOS
        Windows
        OpenBSD [WIP]
        FreeBSD [WIP]
